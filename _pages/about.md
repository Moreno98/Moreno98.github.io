Hi there! I am Moreno D'Inc√† currently a Ph.D. Student at the [MHUG](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/) research group of the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) (Italy) where I am supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/).

My research interests lie in image generation and model fairness.
