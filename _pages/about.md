Hi there! I am Moreno D'Incà a Ph.D. student at the [Multimedia and Human Understanding Group](https://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/) - [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/) (Italy), under the supervision of Prof. [Nicu Sebe](https://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/). My research focuses on generative AI, particularly in Text-to-Image generative models. 

Before, I earned my Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Trento (Italy) after completing my Master’s thesis at the Queen Mary University of London, an opportunity provided by the AI4Media Junior Fellows Exchange Program.
